# Engineer Pathways

## Overview

This is a full stack, user-friendly project to track your team of software developers.  
It allows you to monitor their id, name, role, preferred language, favourite framework/technologies and ideal working style (e.g. work from home/office/hybrid).  
We have built this using handlebars as the templating engine, combined with node/express, mySQL and Sequelize to sync the data.
